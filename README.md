# trello-clone-drag-drop-edit

I want you to create an app as similar as possible to the one shown in this screenshot. It's essentially a Trello clone. It should be able to add new cards (tickets) in each column, change the order of those tickets within a single column, and even move those cards between columns. Use this package for drag-and-drop functionality: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hello-pangea/dnd

Also, make sure users can click on a card, and that card will then become editable, and they will be able to update its content by clicking on a save button on the card or cancel and dismiss the changes by clicking on a Cancel button.

In either case, make sure that once the user has Saved or Cancelled the edit card action, the card returns to its initial uneditable state.

Ask me if you have any questions or need more guidance on how to implement this app.
